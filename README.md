# Sample AngularJS CRUD App

This application serves as a basic list of friends that users can view, update,
and delete from. The app stores data locally in an array. Multiple views were
used and functionality for the app was all provided using directives with AngularJS 1.6.6. You can add new friends, delete friends from the list, or edit a friend's information. However, the data is not persistent and will reset to default objects once you refresh/restart the web page.
